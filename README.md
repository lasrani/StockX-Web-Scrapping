# StockX-Web-Scrapping
Python Script for Scrapping Data from StockX(including the graph)

I have written a python script that can scrape data of over 2000 shoes from StockX.com in one run. The example of data that was scraped via this script can be seen in the folder named "1st Scrape". I intentionally uploading data of only 7-8 shoes, but this script can scrape way more than it (I have tried it!)

All the changes that you have to do have been explained via comments in the script. 

I have taken help from online sources like Stack OverFlow and GeeksForGeeks. 

Happy Coding!
